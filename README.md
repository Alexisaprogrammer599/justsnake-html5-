# justsnake-html5-

made with ai because I had an iPod touch 2G and if you
know anything about those fossils. Than you would know
how hard it is to get apps on it so I just did a probably worse thing by setting it
on a web browser. THAT PREDATES THE DINOSAURS! also "i" made 5 more of these and you can check them out on my github.
Optimised for the worst devices to use the internet on.
